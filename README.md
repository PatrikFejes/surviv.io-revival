# survivio-recreation-attempt

This is my attempt at reviving surviv.io, but since I'm an amateur this is quite impossible to me, So here is my progress so far, in this repository I upload my collected resources so far. I arranged the folders the way I did, because it represents the structure of the game's resources as the website.
Feel free to clone this repo and complete it with the missing resources, and produce a working result. All I want to achieve is to be able to play the game, so I need some support to get it all done.
